### Hi there 👋 

My name is Damla. I am a Front-end Developer & UI Designer & Content Writer & Instructor.

- 👀 Authenticity deeply matters to me. That's why I do my best to create unique as well as eye-catching products.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring new libraries. My mission is to create the best version of me in terms of programming and being a decent human being.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of Front-end & UI design projects
- 🔎 Find my written content on Medium =>  https://medium.com/@Phoenix_Skywalker. I regularly write on programming.
- 🧑‍🎨 Find some of my design projects on CodePen => https://codepen.io/Digital_Nomad
- 📫 You may reach me via derkiner.yeditepe@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun facts: I enjoy experimenting with various vivid healthy recipes as a part of my design journey via
colours as well as shapes and I get great gratification from pedalling back and forth across the country and abroad in an attempt to explore new
places and at times re-discover the old ones through a new perspective.
